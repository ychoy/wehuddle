# WeHuddle

WeHuddle is a Ruby-On-Rails, ActionCable touting, real-time chat application targeted at agile development teams.  This project presented many interesting challenges, including getting ActionCable, a new Rails v5 feature, to implement websockets and render chat windows in real time.  Fun stuff!

**User can see the chat icon and profile icon in the navbar (top right).**

* Chat icon refreshes the chat page index

* The user will see the message in the chat window in real-time

* If user selects the people icon in the right column, they can see the list of active users - profile image thumbnails and names.
* User can sign out
* User is redirected to homepage

## Future Development

* Fix issue - get thumbnails to show up dynamically while chatting.  The problem seems to lie in the asset pipeline and how it fingerprints the path, we just haven't quite worked it out.
* Fix bug - Messages are broadcast in other channels.
